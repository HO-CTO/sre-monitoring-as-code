# Home Office Monitoring-as-Code Overview
The Home Office Monitoring-as-Code (MaC) is a monitoring and alerting framework.
It's a Jsonnet Mixin implementation of Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Error Budgets. It uses Prometheus and Grafana, which are open-source monitoring and alerting systems.

Monitoring-as-code allows platform teams to:

- create a consistent Grafana dashboards across the entire service portfolio
- monitor defined SLOs targets
- measure service reliability

The Monitoring-as-Code implementation follows [SRE best practices](link here).

## How MaC works

MaC takes a Mixin.jsonnet file as an input. Mixin is a monitoring definition file, a set of SLIs and SLOs rules and alerts, packaged together in a reuseable and extensible bundle. The monitoring mixin files (NOTE name them here) bundle up your SLI configuration, alerting, Grafana dashboards, and runbooks into a single package.

MaC contains configuration libraries you can use out of the box, or configure them yourself. NOTE TO REVIEWERS: NEED MORE HERE. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN/DO

MaC creates a dashboard json and associated recording and alert rules for Prometheus and Grafana. When you commit the mixin file MaC packages the Prometheus rules and Grafana dashboards and injects them into the monitoring tools.
