# Get MaC up and running on your local environment
To get started with MaC, download the pre-requisites and set up your test environment using a test implementation.

This allows you to test that the product works on your local environment.

## Clone the repository onto your local machine

To install the framework, clone the [sre-monitoring-as-code](https://github.com/HO-CTO/sre-monitoring-as-code) repository onto your local machine.
This is currently a private repo. If youâ€™d like access to the files, please email [Team email address here]().

For detailed installation instructions, see the Readme file in the 'sast' folder.

## Install pre-requisites

To start using Monitoring-as-Code, you also need to:

- [install Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/download/)
- [install Grafana](https://grafana.com/get/?plcmt=top-nav&cta=downloads)
- [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

## Test your installation
You can use the monitoring-grafana-journey-view mixin file to test that the product works as expected. The mixing file uses the Monitoring-as-code product itself as an input to test.

1. Start monitoring-local.
In terminal, navigate to your monitoring-local folder and enter: <code>docker-compose up</code>
  , or start the service in Docker.
2. Start Grafana.
In your browser window, navigate to ''localhost:3000'. Sign into Grafana using the following credentials:
username: admin
password: l2password

3. In Grafana, navigate to 'monitoring-grafana-journey-view'.
4. Select 'localhost' from the Environment drop-down list.
5. Refresh the home page a couple of times to start building a history.
6. To create errors, you can log out and try logging in with incorrect credentials.
