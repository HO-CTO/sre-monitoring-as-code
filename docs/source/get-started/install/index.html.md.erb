# Get MaC up and running on your local environment
To get started with MaC, download the pre-requisites and set up your test environment using a test implementation.

This allows you to test that the product works on your local environment.

## Clone the repository onto your local machine

To install the framework, clone the [sre-monitoring-as-code](https://github.com/HO-CTO/sre-monitoring-as-code) repository onto your local machine.
This is currently a private repo. If you’d like access to the files, please email [Team email address here]().

For detailed installation instructions, see the Readme file in the 'sast' folder.

## Install pre-requisites

To start using Monitoring-as-Code, you also need to:

- [install Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/download/)
- [install Grafana](https://grafana.com/get/?plcmt=top-nav&cta=downloads)
- [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

## Test your installation
You can use the monitoring-grafana-journey-view mixin file to test that the product works as expected. The mixin file uses the Monitoring-as-Code product itself as an input to test.

For detailed installation instructions, see Readme file in the 'monitoring-local’ folder.
