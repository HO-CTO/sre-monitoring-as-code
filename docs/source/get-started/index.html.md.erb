# Get MaC up and running on your local environment
To get started with MaC, download the pre-requisites and set up your test environment using a test implementation.

This allows you to test that the product works on your local environment.

## Clone the repository onto your local machine

To install the framework, clone the [sre-monitoring-as-code](https://github.com/HO-CTO/sre-monitoring-as-code) repository onto your local machine.
This is currently a public repo open to contributions.

## Install pre-requisites

To start using Monitoring-as-Code, you also need to:

- [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Test your installation
You can use the mixin files within `monitoring-as-code/mixin-defs` to test MaC works as expected.  
This is a more detailed explanation on creating an [example artifact here](https://github.com/HO-CTO/sre-monitoring-as-code/tree/main/monitoring-as-code).  
Once you have created the artifact you can view them in a local Grafana and Prometheus environment using [these instructions](https://github.com/HO-CTO/sre-monitoring-as-code/tree/main/monitoring-as-code).
