# Get MaC up and running on your local environment
To get started with MaC, download the pre-requisites and set up your test environment using a test implementation.

This allows you to test that the product works on your local environment.

## Clone the repository onto your local machine

To install the framework, clone the [sre-monitoring-as-code](https://github.com/HO-CTO/sre-monitoring-as-code) repository onto your local machine.
This is currently a public repo open to contributions.

## Install pre-requisites

To start using Monitoring-as-Code, you also need to:

- [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Run MaC
You can use the mixin files within `monitoring-as-code/mixin-defs` to run MaC.
This is a more detailed explanation on creating an [example artifact here](https://github.com/HO-CTO/sre-monitoring-as-code/tree/main/monitoring-as-code).  
However here are some instructions to get the artifacts created.

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:HO-CTO/sre-monitoring-as-code.git
cd monitoring-as-code
docker build -t sre-monitoring-as-code:latest .
</pre>

Once you have created the artifact you can view them in a local Grafana and Prometheus environment using [these instructions](https://github.com/HO-CTO/sre-monitoring-as-code/tree/main/local).  

However here are some instructions to get the SLIs showing within Grafana and Prometheus.  
Make sure your environment is set up as [mentioned in the readme](https://github.com/HO-CTO/sre-monitoring-as-code/tree/main/local#before-running-the-monitoring-local-environment).  

<pre>
docker-compose up -d
</pre>

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the Grafana dashboards.
Navigate to http://localhost:9081 to view the Prometheus web client.
