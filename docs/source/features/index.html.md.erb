# Benefits and features

## Metrics and alerting

|feature | description |
|--------|-----------|
|The ability to set up SLO alerts for when the SLO status goes below the target value | SLO alerts |
|The ability to set burn rate alerts when the error budget of SLO decreases at a specific rate||
|The ability to measure service availability ||
|The ability to set SLO targets for all types of SLIs| SLO targets are set at the SLI level |
|The ability to define different types of SLIs | MaC is framed around the Google SLO categories. It currently provides Availability, Latency, Freshness and Correctness categories and is fully extensible. |
|The ability to create custom metrics for SLIs| MaC is currently coupled to the Prometheus/Grafana eco-system. Any metric polled, stored and queryed |
|The ability to define user centric SLIs/SLOs. E.g. Is the website available? Is it responding quickly? Is the data correct?||
|The ability to define our own expressions to calculate SLIs||
|The ability to define evaluation time periods for SLOs||
|The ability to collect and expose cloudwatch metrics for SLIs ||
|The ability to collect and expose kubernetes metrics for SLIs ||
|The ability to define and measure an SLO based on user journeys ||
|The ability to use real user monitoring to measure SLOs||
|The ability to define maintenance periods for when an SLO error budget should not be affected||
|The ability to route alerts to different alerting channels. E.g Slack, OpsGenie.||
