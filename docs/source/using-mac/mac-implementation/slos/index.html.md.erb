#  Time Window Based SLOs
A time window based SLO works by taking the number of good windows over a time period and dividing them by the total number of time windows in that period where the metric being used for the SLI was updated. This is easiest to explain with an example:
Lets say you have an SLI for HTTP requests, the time windows for this SLI are 5 minutes long and your SLO performance is being calculated over the past 1 hour. That means 12 time windows will be used for calculating your SLO performance (there are 12 5 minute time windows in 1 hour). The target for your SLO is 80% and the criterion for a time window being good is that at least 90% of the requests performed within that 5 minute window responded with good status codes. The monitoring starts at 14:00, below is the first hour:

|Time |Window number|Number of good requests|Total number of requests|% of good requests|Window status|
|-----|-------------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------|
|14:05|1            |4                      |5                       |80%               |Bad          |
|14:10|2            |9                      |10                      |90%               |Good         |
|14:15|3            |3                      |3                       |100%              |Good         |
|14:20|4            |0                      |0                       |N/A               |No data      |
|14:25|5            |6                      |8                       |75%               |Bad          |
|14:30|6            |0                      |0                       |N/A               |No data      |
|14:35|7            |12                     |12                      |100%              |Good         |
|14:40|8            |5                      |5                       |100%              |Good         |
|14:45|9            |19                     |20                      |95%               |Good         |
|14:50|10           |2                      |3                       |66%               |Bad          |
|14:55|11           |7                      |7                       |100%              |Good         |
|15:00|12           |10                     |11                      |91%               |Good

As you can see, within the first hour there were 7 good windows, 3 bad windows and 2 windows where no requests were made. That means there were 10 total windows where the metric for the SLI was updated (since new requests were made). To calculate the SLO performance for the hour we do 7 (number of good windows) / 10 (total number of windows) which equals 0.7 or 70%. This is lower than the SLO target of 80%, so over the last hour the SLO was not met. Lets look after the next window has been calculated:

|Time |Window number|Number of good requests|Total number of requests|% of good requests|Window status|
|-----|-------------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------|
|14:05|1            |4                      |5                       |80%               |Bad          |
|14:10|2            |9                      |10                      |90%               |Good         |
|14:15|3            |3                      |3                       |100%              |Good         |
|14:20|4            |0                      |0                       |N/A               |No data      |
|14:25|5            |6                      |8                       |75%               |Bad          |
|14:30|6            |0                      |0                       |N/A               |No data      |
|14:35|7            |12                     |12                      |100%              |Good         |
|14:40|8            |5                      |5                       |100%              |Good         |
|14:45|9            |19                     |20                      |95%               |Good         |
|14:50|10           |2                      |3                       |66%               |Bad          |
|14:55|11           |7                      |7                       |100%              |Good         |
|15:00|12           |10                     |11                      |91%               |Good         |
|15:05|13           |15                     |15                      |100%              |Good         |

Since the SLO performance is being calculated over an hour, window 1 is not included in the calculation. That means we now have 8 good windows, 2 bad windows and 2 windows where no requests were made. The calculation for SLO performance is 8 (number of good windows) / 10 (total number of windows) which equals 0.8 or 80%. This is the same as our SLO target of 80%, so over the past hour the SLO was met.
